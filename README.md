1.Serialization
Introduction
Learn the basics of serialization in Django REST Framework.

Setting Up a New Environment
Instructions for setting up your development environment.

Getting Started
Initial setup and configuration.

Creating a Model to Work With
Define a Django model for use with DRF serializers.

Creating a Serializer Class
Create a serializer class to convert model instances to JSON and vice versa.

Working with Serializers
Detailed explanation of using serializers to handle data.

Using ModelSerializers
Leverage ModelSerializer for automatic serializer generation.

Writing Regular Django Views Using Our Serializer
Integrate serializers with Django views.

Testing Our First Attempt at a Web API
Test the API to ensure it's working as expected.

Where Are We Now
Summary of progress and next steps.

2.Requests and Responses
Request Objects
Understand how to handle request data in DRF.

Response Objects
Learn how to return responses from your API.

Status Codes
Explore HTTP status codes and their meanings.

Wrapping API Views
Enhance API views with additional functionality.

Pulling It All Together
Combine request handling, responses, and status codes.

Adding Optional Format Suffixes to Our URLs
Implement optional format suffixes in URLs for flexible API responses.

How's It Looking?
Review the current state of the API.

What's Next?
Plan for the next steps in API development.

3: Class-based Views
Rewriting Our API Using Class-based Views
Transition from function-based views to class-based views.

Using Mixins
Utilize DRF mixins to handle common view operations.

Using Generic Class-based Views
Employ generic views for common patterns and functionalities.

4: Authentication & Permissions
Adding Information to Our Model
Extend the model to support authentication and permissions.

Adding Endpoints for Our User Models
Create API endpoints for user management.

Associating Snippets with Users
Link API resources to users.

Updating Our Serializer
Modify serializers to handle new model fields.

Adding Required Permissions to Views
Implement permission checks in views.

Adding Login to the Browsable API
Enable login functionality in the browsable API interface.

Object Level Permissions
Apply permissions at the object level.

Authenticating with the API
Set up authentication methods for the API.

Summary
Review the authentication and permissions implementation.

5: Relationships & Hyperlinked APIs
Creating an Endpoint for the Root of Our API
Define a root endpoint for the API.

Creating an Endpoint for the Highlighted Snippets
Build endpoints for specific resources or features.

Hyperlinking Our API
Use hyperlinks to create relationships between resources.

Making Sure Our URL Patterns Are Named
Ensure URL patterns are named for easy referencing.

Adding Pagination
Implement pagination to manage large datasets.

Browsing the API
Explore the API through the browsable interface.

6: ViewSets & Routers
Refactoring to Use ViewSets
Refactor the code to use DRFâ€™s ViewSet classes.

Binding ViewSets to URLs Explicitly
Bind ViewSet classes to URLs manually.

Using Routers
Utilize DRF routers to automatically generate URL configurations.

Trade-offs Between Views vs ViewSets
Discuss the advantages and trade-offs of using views versus viewsets.
